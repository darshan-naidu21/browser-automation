# üöÄ Subway Outlet Scraper ‚Äì Agentic Web Automation  

## üìå Overview  
This project automates the extraction of Subway outlet details from **[Subway Malaysia](https://subway.com.my/find-a-subway)**. It uses an **agentic browsing approach** powered by **GPT-4o Mini** and the **Browser Use framework** to interact with the website dynamically.  

## üõ†Ô∏è Key Features  

### ‚úÖ **Agentic Web Scraping**  
- Filters outlets by **Kuala Lumpur**.  
- Scrapes the following details for each outlet:  
  - Name  
  - Full Address  
  - Operating Hours  
  - Waze Direction Link  

### ‚úÖ **Handles Pagination**  
- Detects and navigates through multiple pages to collect all available outlets.  

### ‚úÖ **Conversational Agent Control**  
- Uses an **LLM-powered agent** (`Agent` from `browser_use`) to interact with web elements dynamically.  

### ‚úÖ **Memory & Logging**  
- Saves conversation logs to `"logs/conversation.json"` for debugging and auditing.  

## üñ•Ô∏è **Advanced Browser Automation with Browser Use**  
The project utilizes **Browser Use**, which makes websites accessible for AI agents by providing a powerful, yet simple interface for browser automation.
